Accepts stress-energy source terms of matter (density, specific internal energy, pressure) and electromagnetism (electric field, magnetic field).

Converges on solution via...
* 1. linear solver with solution vector corresponding to stress-energy source terms (which is constantly changing per-iteration, since the stress-energy tensor is based on the metric, which is being solved for)
* 2. JFNK solver whose zero is equal to the EFE: $G\_{ab} - 8 \pi T\_{ab}$

goals:
* 1. (CHECK) verify Newtonian gravity matches Schwarzschild gravity from on to above the surface (I'm not doing this here, but I've done this in my solar system project)
* 2. (CHECK) verify Schwarzschild stellar model gravity due to analytical connection equations is maximal at surface, $\rightarrow 0$ as $r \rightarrow 0$ and $r \rightarrow \infty$
* 3. (CHECK) verify Schwarzschild stellar model gravity due to finite difference matches the analytical connection equation values
* 4. (CHECK) verify, with flat spacetime and stellar stress-energy, that the EFE constraint error is equal to the stellar body stress-energy within the body, and zero elsewhere.
* 5. (CHECK) verify, with Schwarzschild stellar model and stellar stress-energy, that the EFE constraint is near zero everywhere. ... well this works inside the planet and outside the planet, but on the changes in rho this has some numerical errors.
* 6. (CHECK) add time 2nd derivatives to metric prims, from this compute time derivatives of connections, from that the Riemann, and then the Ricci and Einstein
* 6. (sort of) get JFNK to work.
	My goal is to start at flat space, given Earth's stress-energy source term, and come up with Earth's gravity, as the Schwarzschild analytical answer already gives us.
	I am getting descent, however it is going really slow, so I'm going to port this project to OpenCL...

Newton, Schwarzschild-based EOS gravity using Earth's parameters, and Kerr-based EOS gravity.
Schwarzschild-based EOS is taken from Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's "Gravitation" box 23.2 on the TOV equations of structure starting from a Schwarzschild metric. 
Note that the Kerr metric is approximated within the body as the Kerr metric, using for mass all matter contained within the radial coordinate.
This is not a correct equation of structure for the Kerr metric, as the correct Kerr EOS has not yet been solved for.

![alt text](images/kerr%20with%20vs.%20without%20rotation.png)

Difference between Kerr metric with and without rotation.
Note that Kerr without rotation exhibits less gravitational acceleration than Kerr with rotation, while Schwarzschild (which is rotation-less) exhibits more gravitational acceleration than Kerr.

Some thoughts on results ...

Here are the variable ranges, initializing the stress-energy prims with the earth, initializing the metric prims with a flat metric:
